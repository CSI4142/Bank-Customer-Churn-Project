# CSI4142 - Project - Bank Customer Churn Analysis

The Bank Customer Churn project aims to carry out an extensive exploration of the customer churn data of the ABC Multistate Bank using various data science techniques and analytical tools.

The steps involved will range from developing a dimensional model to better display the data characteristics and analysis process, to building data marts and performing the ETL process. Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) will also be used to perform multi-dimensional data analysis, followed by the development of Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards for data visualization and trend identification.

Finally, we will use data mining techniques to discover hidden patterns, classify data, and develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict customer churn.

## End Goal

The results of this project could help enhance customer retention strategies, optimize business profitability, and improve overall customer satisfaction by identifying key factors leading to churn in the banking industry.
